# Considering Bias in Data

## Project Goal
The goal of this assignment is to explore the concept of bias in data using Wikipedia articles. This assignment will consider articles on political figures from different countries. This will be done by combining a dataset of Wikipedia articles with a dataset of country populations, and with the combined dataset, use a machine learning service called ORES to estimate the quality of each article.

Analysis will be performed of how the coverage of politicians on Wikipedia and the quality of articles about politicians varies among countries. Analysis consists of a series of tables that show:
The countries with the greatest and least coverage of politicians on Wikipedia compared to their population.
The countries with the highest and lowest proportion of high quality articles about politicians.
A ranking of geographic regions by articles-per-person and proportion of high quality articles.
